          <p>
            Students from the Web Technology course (2ID60) had to form
            groups by themselves. An online forum on Sakai was used by
            many students to find other teammates. This resulted in many
            posts on the forum from students who were still looking for a group. The forum on Sakai has two               main disadvantages: firstly the lack of a clear overview and secondly the missing background                 information of students. As many students participate in university courses, you may want to collaborate with students you only know by face not by name. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We from group 8, Christian, Lars, Roy and Koen, thought: this
            process could be organized much more efficiently. That is why we have
            created Groupmolder: the easiest way to form groups.
